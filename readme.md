# Main Uses
This software is meant to open an image (moslty images you download from the internet) or any image you want to use as a texture for BFBB
and prepare it for Industrial Park by resizing it to the proper resolution that BFBB (or other HI games) understands quickly without needing any major software (like Photoshop, GIMP etc) as well as resize to a custom
resolution if needed.
